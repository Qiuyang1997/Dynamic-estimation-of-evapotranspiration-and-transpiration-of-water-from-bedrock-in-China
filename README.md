Water stored in bedrock plays an indispensable role in ecosystems’ water supply, and numerous studies have shown this hidden reservoir contributes significantly to plant water uptake to maintain high physiological performance and resistance to drought. However, conventional ecohydrological frameworks typically confine water availability assessments to soil moisture, thereby overlooking bedrock water. Here we introduce a novel dynamic bedrock water evapotranspiration model that integrates the evolving state of soil available water with multi‐year remote sensing data and extensive field observations across diverse climatic zones in China. Our results reveal that more than 50% of shallow bedrock regions exhibit evapotranspiration from bedrock-stored water, supplementing up to approximately 7.8% of the total transpiration for vegetation. Moreover, the analysis shows that in arid/semi-arid or seasonal arid areas, the longer early growth periods and decoupling water-carbon dynamics have a promoting effect on increasing the utilization ratio of bedrock water. These quantitative findings challenge the conventional soil-centric view by demonstrating the critical, climate-dependent role of bedrock water in buffering hydrological deficits, enhancing forest resilience, and refining predictions of ecosystem responses under extreme climatic events.

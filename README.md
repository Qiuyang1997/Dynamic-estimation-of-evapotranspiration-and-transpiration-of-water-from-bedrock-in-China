Water stored in bedrock plays an indispensable role in ecosystems’ water supply, and numerous studies have shown this hidden reservoir contributes significantly to plant water uptake to maintain high physiological performance and resistance to drought. However, conventional ecohydrological frameworks typically confine water availability assessments to soil moisture, thereby overlooking bedrock water. Here we introduce a novel dynamic bedrock water evapotranspiration model that integrates the evolving state of soil available water with multi‐year remote sensing data and extensive field observations across diverse climatic zones in China. Our results reveal that more than 50% of shallow bedrock regions exhibit evapotranspiration from bedrock-stored water, supplementing up to approximately 7.99% of the total transpiration for vegetation. Moreover, the analysis shows that in arid/semi-arid and seasonal arid areas, the longer early growth periods and decoupling of water-carbon dynamics enhance the utilization ratio of bedrock water. These quantitative findings challenge the conventional soil-centric view, and demonstrate bedrock-stored water can enhance ecosystems’ productivity and refine predictions of ecosystem responses under drought events.

In this project, we have released reproducible codes for calculating daily evapotranspiration from bedrock reservoirs and vegetation transpiration based on soil available water, ET, and P, which mainly consist of fiveparts: 1. Main calculation code (Part1-6)(including deficits of ET-P, water deficit calculation,soil available water status dynamic estimation, ET_bedrock and VT_bedrock estimation); 2. Analysis of phenological characteristics of the ecosystem; 3. Simple effect analysis based on causal machine learning; 4.Monte Carlo simulation of uncertainty propagation caused by input data errors ;5.Video production of daily estimated values.
